[![Visual Studio Marketplace Version](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/v/chuckjonas.apex-pmd) ![Visual Studio Marketplace Installs - Azure DevOps Extension](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/azure-devops/installs/total/chuckjonas.apex-pmd)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chuckjonas.apex-pmd)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ChuckJonas/vscode-apex-pmd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ChuckJonas/vscode-apex-pmd)

Allows you to run [Apex Static Analysis](https://pmd.github.io/latest/index.html) directly in vscode on Apex,  VisualForce & other XML metadata files.

## Features

![Apex PMD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChuckJonas/vscode-apex-pmd/master/images/apex-pmd.gif)

### Current actions Supported

- Run analysis on file open
- Run analysis on file save
- Run analysis on file change (new!)
- Run analysis on entire workspace
- Run analysis on single file
- Ability to define your own ruleset

## System Requirements

- Must have JRE >= 1.8 installed and in path
- See [PMD System Requirements](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_userdocs_installation.html#requirements) for more details

## Configuration

- `rulesets` (optional): set to override default ruleset (see "Defining your own ruleset" for more details)
- `runOnFileOpen`: run every time a file is opened in vscode
- `runOnFileSave`: run every time a file is saved
- `runOnFileChange`: Run when a file is changed. NOTE: this is "debounced" to prevent performance issues. Delay can be adjusted via `onFileChangeDebounce`.
- `priorityErrorThreshold`: Determines at what priority level 'errors' will be added. Anything less will be a warning or hint
- `priorityWarnThreshold`: Determines at what priority level 'warnings' will be added. Anything less will be a hint
- `enableCache`: Creates a cache file for PMD to run faster. Will create a .pmdCache file in your workspace
- `pmdBinPath` (prev. `pmdPath`) (optional): set to override the default pmd binaries. This should point to the PMD folder which contains folders `lib` and `bin`. Most likely it is called `libexec`.
- `additionalClassPaths` (optional): set of paths to be appended to classpath. Used to find jar files containing custom rule definitions. Can be absolute or relative to workspace.
- `commandBufferSize` Size of buffer used to collect PMD command output (MB), may need to be increased for very large projects
- `jrePath` (Optional) Path to JRE (Folder that contains which contains `bin/java`)

### Defining your own "Ruleset"

I recommend you use the [default ruleset](https://github.com/ChuckJonas/vscode-apex-pmd/blob/master/rulesets/apex_ruleset.xml) as a starting point.

Set `apexPMD.rulesets` string array to reference your custom rulesets. You can either use the absolute paths, or a relative paths from your workspace (EG `my-apex-rules.xml`).

You can also mention the default ruleset in `apexPMD.rulesets`. To do this add `default` value to the array.

[Apex Ruleset Reference](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_apex.html)

NOTE: If you move away from the default ruleset in an sfdx project, make sure to exclude the `.sfdx` generated classes by keeping this line:

`<exclude-pattern>.*/.sfdx/.*</exclude-pattern>`

### Using custom rules written in Java

If you want to use your own [custom rules](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_extending_writing_pmd_rules.html) from a jar file, then the jar file must be on the classpath. By default, the PMD folder and the workspace root folder are included in the classpath. You can add further folders using the `additionalClassPaths` setting. This ["Hello world"](https://github.com/andrewgilbertsagecom/pmd-custom-rule-sample) example is a good starting place for beginners.
