## [0.3.0]
### Added
- New setting `apexPMD.rulesets`. This is a replacement for the deprecated `apexPMD.rulesetPath` setting. You can specify a list of rulesets you need to analyze your code against.
### Removed
- `apexPMD.rulesetPath` setting is now deprecated. It still works for backward compatibility but consider moving to a newer setting `apexPMD.rulesets`.
### Changed
- `apexPMD.pmdBinPath` description is updated to reduce confusion over this setting.
